# STATS507-Project
## Diabetes Prediction Based on Demographics, Lab Tests, and Health Survey Data
This repository was created for the  Winter 2025 STATS 507 course project. This project applies several machine learning models to predict diabetes using structured health survey data from the CDC, which can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Bena345/cdc-diabetes-health-indicators/tree/main. We evaluate five classifiers—including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, and multi-layer perceptron—on a dataset of over 240,000 individuals. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was applied, and models were compared using AUC, recall, and F1-score. Gradient boosting achieved the best overall performance. Logistic regression was used for interpretability, identifying age, BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, and general health as key predictors. Results demonstrate the utility of machine learning for effective diabetes risk prediction and feature interpretation.
